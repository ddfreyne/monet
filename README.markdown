Monet
=====

...

Requirements
------------

* SDL
* Foundation

Foundation is part of Cocoa, which comes with Mac OS X. There are several open-source implementations for Foundation:

* [Cocotron](http://www.cocotron.org/) (probably the most complete)
* [libFoundation](http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Monitor/7464/libFoundation/) (likely outdated)
* [nuFound](http://github.com/timburks/nufound/tree/master) (possibly incomplete)
* [GNUstep](http://www.gnustep.org/)

Usage

Goals
-----

Monet's goal is to be an Objective-C wrapper for SDL, inspired by Cocoa's AppKit.

Ideally, an application that uses Monet should be able to do everything it needs without needing to interface with SDL directly. However, not all functionality from SDL will be available in Monet; features that are not used in Llama will be left out.

History
------

First, there was Gosu-Monet (Gosu + Ruby). Then, there was Allegro-Monet (Allegro + Obj-C). Now, there is SDL-Monet (SDL + Obj-C).
